# VU-Spec
VU mod offering standard spectator functionality

Will use this to list some ToDo's/ Issues:

 - UI disappears sometimes when a player dies, or gets killed i.e out of bounds death.
 - shows Assault Rifle instead of m320/m26 in gadget slot.
 - primaryAmmo and secondaryAmmo doesnt work in Vext for other players then the client <a href="https://github.com/EmulatorNexus/VeniceUnleashed/issues/459">see here</a>
 - accuracy is always 100% because not implemented
 - vehicle icons are not implemented in the playercard info
 - capture point objectives/ icons doesnt change the state (they should change the colors at least)
 - we need a GameInterActionEntity for Rush/SQRush/CTF (Rush for Objectives| CTF for the "ticket" count)
 - we have to disable tickets for Gunmaster
 - there is no support for SQDM
 - the bottom bar with kills, deaths, k/d, accuracy is cut in half in 720p
 - spectator doesn't work with bots
 - adjust nade and ammo icon sizes 
 - improvement: Display the amount of spectators for the spectated player
